# Econometrics_Project
The aim of this project is to describe a regression model predicting the results of the U.S. presidential elections as well as providing an inference regarding the relationship between different economic and political variables. The dependent variable in this model is the ratio of the democratic party vote vs. the sum of both republican and democratic party votes.
### Methods:
This part of the study was based on the Fair model (2018b). For this purpose, the panel data model was constructed in the RStudio development environment using the PLM library. To utilize the PLM library two other libraries were drawn upon, “tidyverese” and “haven”. Six variables were manipulated in the study to which the above mentioned model was applied.
